# 2022-Tic-Tac-Toe

During today's meeting you have to make tic tac toe.
There's some boilerplate code for python in starter.py

In addition, if you add some twist to the normal tic tac toe game by next week's meeting you may get a cup cake, however, you must make a pull request to this repository to get it.
